The Hotel Booking Styles plugin allows you to further customize the styling of the WordPress [MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/). This is a helpful utility if you use the Hotel Booking plugin in the themes other than those by MotoPress.

The plugin ships with a bundle of ready-made CSS classes for tailoring such essentials as the property search form, booking forms, and other shortcodes/blocks sourced by Hotel Booking. Since this is a user-friendly list of styles, the Hotel Booking Styles & Templates plugin can be especially beneficial for non-tech users.

You can also create custom templates for the accommodation type pages, which will allow you to change the default look of the individual accommodation listings. For example, you can change the order of the accommodation details, turn an image gallery into a slider, choose which extra attributes to show, and do even more tweaks via a user-friendly interface.
