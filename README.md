# Hotel Booking Styles: Extra Styles for MotoPress Hotel Booking Plugin

The Hotel Booking Styles plugin allows you to further customize the styling of the WordPress [MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/). This is a helpful utility if you use the Hotel Booking plugin in the themes other than those by MotoPress.

The plugin ships with a bundle of ready-made CSS classes for tailoring such essentials as the property search form, booking forms, and other shortcodes/blocks sourced by Hotel Booking. Since this is a user-friendly list of styles, the Hotel Booking Styles plugin can be especially beneficial for non-tech users.
