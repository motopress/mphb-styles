Extra CSS styles to customize the MotoPress WordPress Hotel Booking plugin forms and widgets.

== Description ==

This is an extension to the MotoPress [WordPress Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/) for hotels.

It provides you with a bundle of ready-made CSS classes for customizing the property search form, booking forms, and other Hotel Booking shortcodes/blocks.

The Hotel Booking styles addon will help you revamp and enhance your hotel website design with the required style adjustment.

The add-on also works for the [free Hotel Booking](https://wordpress.org/plugins/motopress-hotel-booking-lite/) plugin version.

With the Hotel Booking Styles addon, it’s super easy to take the customization of the WordPress hotel booking plugin further and apply the following changes to your forms:

* Make the property search form horizontal.
* Remove field labels.
* Remove paddings between the form fields.
* Hide the "Required fields are followed by *" indication.
* Apply an automatic form width adjustment (using a wrapper).
* Stretch the button in the property search form or widget to adjust it to the width of your website container.
* Set custom width for the form fields.

You don’t need any technical background to modify the styles, just copy and paste them to the needed blocks or shortcodes!

The focus of our roadmap is to add more styles and make this plugin even handier by transforming the way you add styles into a more user-friendly settings panel.

*The MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin must be installed and activated.*
